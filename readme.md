First Fork and clone this repo to your terminal!

Spend 5 minutes and answer the following questions.
Quiz your neighbor on them!

- What is a headless browser?
browser without GUI, so it only accesses web pages for other programs (no humans, no need for GUI)

- What is Selenium?
program used to automate other operations

- What is yml?
yml = yet another mark-up language
looks like python, white space sensitive, must be indented
like json files used for certain configuration

- What is end to end testing?
go from start to finish to see if app is behaving as it should, based on user stories
could be very high level, such as show certain information to user if not logged in to get them to sign up, can then be automated

- What is continuous integration?
development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early
continual merging in code, then run tests and if they still work then everything's okay
if it breaks it's because our code went wrong

- What should it expect to happen if the lotion isn't in the basket?
